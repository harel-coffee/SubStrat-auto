# Stability Feature Selection Dataset Summary

In this project, we obtain a "good" summary of a dataset based on the approach of stable feature selection.
We define a summary to be a "good" summary if it is both stable and optimize some condition we would like to preserve in a dataset.

## Usage 

1. Clone the repo
2. Install the '**requirements.txt**' file (pip install requirements.txt)
3. Put the relevant data (columns and file format are shown in the bottom of this file).
4. run the project from the **main.py** file (python main.py or python3 main.py)

## Data 
The project requires two data files:
1. Query sessions dataset (as a **CSV** file) - a data set of users' queries in the following format:
2. A dataset instance of the data the users' queries performed on (for the fitness evaluation of the genes).
